The first file Manual_section.py is used to identify the xpath of independent sections and calls screenshots.py which actually takes the screenshot
You just need to run Manual_sections.py to take section screenshots
Same goes for primer links run Manual_sections2.py
In order to determine the elements which acts as section just run height.py it will print the id of the section element(works for primer links only)
